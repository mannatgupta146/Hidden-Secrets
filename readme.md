# Hidden Secrets

## Purpose
Have you ever found it difficult to reveal a secret to someone? **Hidden Secrets** is an interactive web project designed to mirror that very feeling of hesitation and intrigue. Just like hiding a secret, the project lets you uncover something hidden only when you engage with itâ€”by hovering over the page. The background changes, and a secret message appears, providing an immersive experience that draws users into the world of mystery. 

## Features
- **Full-screen canvas background** with dynamic animations that evolve as users interact with the page.
- **Hover effect** that reveals a hidden secret message when users hover over the page.
- **Responsive design** that ensures a smooth user experience across various screen sizes.
- **Smooth transitions** that make the uncovering of the secret message feel seamless and engaging.
- **Customizable styles** that make it easy to modify text, fonts, background colors, and animations.

## How It Works
The project leverages a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver the following features:

- **HTML Canvas**: The background is a dynamic canvas that responds to user interaction and provides a visually rich experience.
- **CSS**: It handles the hover effect, text centering, and overall styling to ensure the secret remains hidden until revealed by user action.
- **JavaScript**: The script controls the hover functionality, revealing the hidden secret when triggered by the userâ€™s interaction.

### Hover to Reveal the Secret Message
The secret message stays hidden until the user hovers over the page. This effect is implemented using the `:hover` pseudo-class in CSS and a hidden `<div>` element that appears when triggered, adding a layer of excitement as the secret is unveiled.
